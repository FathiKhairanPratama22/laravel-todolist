To Do List App is a simple application designed to help users organize and manage their daily activities in a more structured and efficient manner. It was developed as part of a web development learning project using the Laravel framework. With features such as to-do list creation, job description, and user account integration, the app aims to provide an intuitive and productive user experience. We believe that good time management starts with organized planning and To Do List App is a digital solution to support that.
